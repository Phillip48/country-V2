## Description  
Who doesn't wanna travel the world? Taking my personal P1 project and redoing it with what I learned in P2.  . It works by using REST Countries API and the Google Maps API. This app allows you to see where a country is located and some information about the country. Not to mention follow other users and review the countries youve visited... and of course have a favorites list.   
This is still a work in progress and not finished  
Version 1 was disabled...
