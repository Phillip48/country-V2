## Description  
Who doesn't wanna travel the world? Taking my personal P1 project and redoing it with what I learned in P2.  . It works by using REST Countries API and the Google Maps API. This app allows you to see where a country is located and some information about the country. Not to mention follow other users and review the countries youve visited... and of course have a favorites list.

## The Project

Create a Full Stack Web Application with the following features:

- [x] Use a Node and Express web server
- [x] Backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM
- [x] Migration strategy using seeds and schema files
- [x] Routes for retrieving and adding new data

- [x] Folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
- [x] Use Handlebars for server-side templating
- [x] Protected API keys in Node with environment variables
- [x] Polished front end/UI
- [x] Meet good-quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
- [x] Deployed using Heroku (with data)

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:

* Research on the different API's used.
* Define the purpose, and concept of the application before starting to code.
* Work through what needed to be done first.
* Create sketches for each web page.
* Define the routes, requests and responses structure.
* Integrate a full stack application.


## Usage

**User Story**

As the user I...  want to be able to see different information about other countries. I also want to be able to write reviews about the countries and see what other people have also said. I should be able to follow other users and save countries to my favorites list.
